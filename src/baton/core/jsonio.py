"""Crash-safe JSON and text persistence.

Ported from the original workspace ``scripts/utils.py``, with the POSIX-only
``fcntl`` dependency replaced by a portable lock so Baton runs on Windows too.

The guarantee callers rely on: a kill at any instant leaves either the previous
file fully intact or the new file fully written — never a truncated one. Every
piece of resumable pipeline state in Baton goes through here.
