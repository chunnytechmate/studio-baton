"""A person's confirmed answer to "send this lesson with no recording?"

`send lesson` refuses a session with no video (:mod:`baton.exits` ``NEEDS_HUMAN``)
and used to accept ``--without-video`` as a bare flag past that stop. A bare
flag is something anything that can run a command line can pass — including
an agent that has never asked anyone, and is following the CLI's own contract
faithfully by doing so.

What is checked instead is a code nobody driving Baton can produce on their
own: :func:`request` sends it to a real person over a channel Baton already
trusts (the studio's configured messenger), and never returns it to whatever
called the command. Only a person reading their own phone has it. ``send
lesson --without-video <code>`` is then not a bypass — it is where that
person's answer re-enters the process that asked the question, and
:func:`verify_and_consume` accepts it exactly once.

Scoped to one learner's one session and expiring on its own, so a code
overheard or logged somewhere is not a standing key to anything.
