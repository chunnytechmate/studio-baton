"""Retry helpers with exponential backoff and jitter.

Ported from the original ``scripts/utils.py``. The behaviour that matters and
is preserved verbatim: a non-retryable HTTP response is *returned* so the
caller can branch on its status, while only exhausted retries raise. Silently
swallowing a 401 as "transient" is how a pipeline ends up looping against a
revoked token.
