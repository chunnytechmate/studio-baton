"""Two ways to report the same result: for a person, and for a program.

Every command produces one result object. In human mode it is printed as
aligned text; with ``--json`` it is printed as a single JSON document on
stdout and nothing else. An agent driving Baton always passes ``--json`` and
reads the envelope, which has the same shape for success and failure.

Progress and diagnostics go to stderr in both modes, so ``--json`` output stays
parseable even when a pipeline is chatty.
