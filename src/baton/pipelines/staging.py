"""Lesson drafts on their way to being published.

A lesson is staged, then summarised, then published: often across separate
commands, sometimes across separate days, and occasionally across a crash. Each
draft is one atomically-written file under ``<state>/lessons/``.

Publishing records what succeeded per target. Re-running skips a target that is
already done, which is what makes ``publish`` safe to retry: appending the same
summary twice leaves a document with two copies of it, and nothing in Notion
will tell you which is which.
