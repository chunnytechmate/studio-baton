"""Collecting recordings, combining them, publishing, and linking back.

The pipeline is per-learner and every step is recorded before the next begins,
so a crash anywhere is re-runnable. Three properties are load-bearing, and each
one exists because its absence caused a real loss:

**Nothing is deleted until everything else succeeded.** Source clips are moved
to the trash as the last step, after the upload and the document link. Deleting
earlier means a crash between the delete and the upload loses the recording
permanently: the studio has no copy, and neither does anyone else.

**A completed upload is never repeated.** ``uploaded`` is recorded with the
video id the moment YouTube returns it. A resume that re-uploaded would leave
two copies of a child's lesson online with no way to tell which link was sent.

**One learner's failure does not stop the others.** Each is wrapped, and the
run reports per learner. A phone that produced a corrupt clip must not mean
nobody's recording goes out that night.
