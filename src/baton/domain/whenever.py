"""Turning what a person types into a date and a time.

The original told the agent to "parse the shorthand into YYYY-MM-DD before
calling the script". That is arithmetic, and arithmetic is the last thing to
leave to a language model: an off-by-one here books a lesson on the wrong day
and nobody notices until a family arrives to an empty room.

So it is a function, and a command. Shorthand tokens are configuration, because
"พน" means tomorrow to one studio and nothing at all to another. The same goes
for weekday names and the words a studio uses to say when in the day a lesson
happens: the vocabulary is the profile's, the arithmetic is always code's.
