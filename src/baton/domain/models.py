"""The things a teaching studio keeps track of.

Deliberately small. A learner, the numbered sessions they work through, the
pieces they are studying, and the recordings that come out of it: that is the
whole model, and every adapter maps its own storage onto exactly this.

Each model keeps a ``raw`` dict of the source record. Studios have columns
Baton knows nothing about, and dropping them on the floor would make Baton a
lossy layer over the user's own data.
