"""Translating a studio's own status wording into Baton's three states.

A studio writes "Done", "Complete", "เสร็จแล้ว", or anything else. Baton needs
to reason about exactly three states, so ``docs.statuses`` maps its vocabulary
onto the studio's and this module does the lookup in both directions.

Matching is case- and space-insensitive: a status typed by hand into Notion
picks up stray capitals and trailing spaces, and treating "In Progress " as a
different state from "In progress" would silently hide a session in progress.
