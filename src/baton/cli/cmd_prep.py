"""``baton prep`` — the day's lesson-prep report, behind a hard gate.

Walking into a lesson means knowing three things about the last one: what was
covered, what was set to practise, and where the teaching goes next. The
pages hold all of it, but assembling it by hand is exactly the work an agent
does badly under time pressure — sections get dropped, links get mangled, and
the teacher walks in half-briefed. So the report is built by the command, and
the agent's job is to hand it over untouched.

Two rules make that safe, and both are enforced here rather than asked of
whoever is driving:

* **Fail closed.** A learner appears in the report only when every required
  field of their latest session is present — name, date, pieces, the page
  link, the overview, the content, the homework. A learner whose page is
  half-written is listed as blocked, with the fields it lacks; when nobody
  passes, there is no report at all and the command exits ``5``.
* **The report is the output.** What Baton prints is what the teacher reads.
  An agent relays it verbatim or not at all; re-composing it is how links
  went missing in the system this replaces.

Who to prepare comes from the calendar by default — every learner booked on
the day — or from explicit ``--learner`` flags. The next goal is a warning
rather than a requirement: plenty of pages end without one, and a missing
plan is worth seeing, not worth blocking the whole briefing over.
