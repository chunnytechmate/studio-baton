"""``baton lesson`` — stage a lesson, validate a written summary, publish it.

The loop an agent follows, and the reason it is three commands rather than one:

    baton lesson stage    "Ada"              # collect context
    baton lesson contract "Ada"              # → JSON Schema + that context
    …the model writes JSON…
    baton lesson ingest   "Ada" --file s.json  # validated, or exit 4 with reasons
    baton lesson render   "Ada"              # deterministic preview
    baton lesson publish  "Ada"              # onto the document

`contract` hands the model everything it needs and tells it exactly what shape
to return. `ingest` is where a wrong shape stops — nothing is stored, and every
violation comes back at once with a pointer, so the next attempt is informed
rather than another guess.
