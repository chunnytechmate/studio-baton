"""A localhost checklist for marking learners as no longer studying.

The constraints are deliberate:

* **stdlib only** (``http.server``, ``html``, ``urllib.parse``): the CLI has
  no web framework anywhere, and one screen of HTML does not earn one.
* **single-threaded**: ``SqliteStore`` holds one connection, and SQLite
  connections are not thread-safe. ``HTTPServer``, never the threading
  variant, so a request cannot hop threads onto it.
* **bound to 127.0.0.1**: this is a screen for the teacher at the machine
  (over a port forward if remote), not a service.
* **render/apply split**: the page and the write are plain functions the
  tests drive directly; only the socket glue knows a socket exists.

The page never trusts the browser for anything: the form posts learner ids,
the ids are matched against the live roster before anything is written, and
unknown ids are dropped rather than guessed at.
