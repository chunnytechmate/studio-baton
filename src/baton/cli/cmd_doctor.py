"""``baton doctor`` — check the installation before it is trusted with real work.

This is the merged descendant of the per-skill preflight scripts. It runs every
cheap check that can fail at 2am and reports all of them at once, because
finding three problems in one run beats discovering them one re-run at a time.

Doctor changes nothing a caller can observe and never falls back to a secondary
store: its job is to notice that the primary is down, not to paper over it. The
one thing it writes is a probe file under the state directory, created and
deleted again to prove the directory is writable — which also creates the state
directory if it is missing.
