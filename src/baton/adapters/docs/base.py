"""What a session-document store must do.

A "document" is the page a learner and their family actually read: what was
covered, what to practise, the recording. Baton needs four things from it —
read the status and date, list the blocks, replace the summary without
destroying anything else, and append.

The fourth is the one that matters. :class:`PreservePolicy` encodes the rule
that used to live in prose ("never clear the whole page — the videos and sheet
links are on it"), so a rewrite physically cannot delete an uploaded recording.

    way, rather than each growing its own copy that quietly drifts from the
    other (the original system had this duplicated across skills).

    Two rules keep the *song being learnt* from being read as the recording of
    the lesson. A studio keeps both on the same page, and once the song is a
    YouTube link — for a pop song it always is — nothing in the shape of the
    URL tells the two apart:

    * a `video` block wins over a bookmark or an embed however far up the page
      it sits. The pipeline writes the recording as a `video` block; Notion
      turns a pasted song URL into a bookmark and an embed, and those land
      below it. Reading the last link on the page therefore read the song.
    * a URL named in ``exclude`` is never the recording, in any shape.

    Args:
        blocks: Block types that may hold the link. The default matches the
            shapes the previous system accepted; ``docs.video_link_blocks``
            overrides it per studio.
        exclude: URLs that are something other than this lesson's recording —
            in practice the piece's own ``source_link``. Compared by video
            identity, not as strings, so the song still matches after Notion
            has rewritten it into another of YouTube's URL shapes.

    A document-store failure degrades to "no recording link" rather than
    raising: the field is optional everywhere it is read, so an outage here
    must not stop whatever the caller was doing for its own required data.
