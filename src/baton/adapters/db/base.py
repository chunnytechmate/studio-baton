"""What a learner store must do, and how config maps onto a real schema.

The protocol is small and read-heavy. Writes are limited to the few things a
pipeline genuinely has to record, because every write is a way for Baton to
damage data a studio already owns.

:class:`FieldMap` is what makes "adopt an existing schema" a config change
rather than a fork: every table and column name comes from ``baton.yaml``, and
identifiers are validated before they are ever interpolated into SQL.
